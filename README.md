ink is a prototype-based language<br>
The current interpreter is quite sluggish and I'm working on it<br>
A possible faster backend [ivm](https://github.com/rod-lin/ivm "ivm") is under developing<br><br>
The grammar is constantly changing so sadly there's no doc currently...<br>
Some testing examples are available at /example directory if you're interested
